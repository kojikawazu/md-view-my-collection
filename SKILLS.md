## Current Development Notes
- `base/` is read-only; all work happens in `front/` (copied once at dev start).
- Requirements are documented in:
  - `docs/02.ui-layout.md` (latest UI layout)
  - `docs/03.requirements.md` (requirements + coding rules)
  - `docs/04.e2e-cases.md` (strict E2E cases)
- Stack: TypeScript + React + TailwindCSS.
- Markdown rendering: react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-sanitize with images and external links allowed.
- Auth: Supabase Auth planned; Supabase setup handled in a separate project.
- Prisma: schema is pulled only via `prisma db pull` (no schema editing).
- Testing: E2E only (Playwright), no unit tests.
- Deployment: Vercel, `main` branch only, `front/` only, no previews.
